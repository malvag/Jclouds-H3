> S3proxy:1.7.1: it says we should compile it with JDK 7 and their tests can't even run in JDK 7. 
(change_JDK:JDK 8)


> S3proxy:1.7.1: JRE has to run with JRE 9+ to pass class mismatch with JH3.
(change_JRE:JDK 9+)


> Jclouds:2.2.1: It uses animal-sniffer-plugin that can check signatures up to JDK 8 but our JH3 has JDK 9 as a target so we canâ€™t compile them with the animal-sniffer-plugin active.
(maven-plugin: animal-sniffer-plugin:skipped)


> Our jclouds:H3 api provider is meant to be installed on its own with JDK 7 explicitly.
